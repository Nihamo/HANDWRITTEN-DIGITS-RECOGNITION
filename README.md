# HANDWRITTEN-DIGITS-RECOGNITION
This project focuses on image processing with a model specifically trained for handwritten digit recognition. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, the system analyzes and classifies   digit images with high accuracy. The model's architecture leverages convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract and interpret features from input images.

The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. This dataset provides a robust foundation for evaluating the model's ability to classify digit images accurately.
