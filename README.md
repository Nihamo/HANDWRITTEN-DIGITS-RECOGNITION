# üß† Handwritten Digits Recognition

This project focuses on image processing with a model specifically trained for handwritten digit recognition. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, the system analyzes and classifies digit images with high accuracy. The model's architecture leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract and interpret features from input images.

## üìä Dataset

The model is trained using the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a widely recognized benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. This dataset provides a robust foundation for evaluating the model's ability to classify digit images accurately.

## üß± Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **Numpy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **TensorFlow**: Framework for building and training the model.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Model architecture for feature extraction and classification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nihamo/HANDWRITTEN-DIGITS-RECOGNITION.git
   cd HANDWRITTEN-DIGITS-RECOGNITION
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the Model**:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Make Predictions**:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path_to_image
   ```

   Replace `path_to_image` with the path to the image you want to classify.
